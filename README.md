# Venture

This project is something I did for fun and repetition. The idea for this was to make something similar to the company “Live it” that offers experiences that you can give to someone (or yourself) but make it more about the outdoors and the outdoor experiences you wouldn’t normally find. 
The color palette in this project is energetic and matches both the company name and what they offer.

HTML and CSS was used for this project and JavaScript for the responsive menu.
